    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "## SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Slow to train on large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Is a binary classifier. For multiclass classification you will have to train 1 classifier per class in a 1 vs all way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Knowing which Kernel to use is difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths : \n",
    "\n",
    "1) After training, it doesn't need to query values of the past, so it predicts fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Tries to maximize the margins. This tends do better when predicting new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Works with lots of complicated decision boundaries thanks to the kernel trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Works well even with few data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Aplications:\n",
    "\n",
    "General classification and prediction. Used for disseases detection, Facial expression classification, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why did I chose it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because SVM can achieve very good accuracy even with few data points (which is our case). Altough SVM is slow when training with a lot of data points, we don't have much data points so we will be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Assumes that the features are conditionally independent.\n",
    "2) Provides probabilities that are not that accuarate, but if you don't care about the number itself but instead you are going to just output the class, then it is meaningful. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Works well even if there are features missing in an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Easy to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Aplications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Used only for classification problems. Used in : Credit approval, target marketing, medical diagnosis, spam filtering, text classification and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why did I chose it:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, because it is a really good classifier, although is a bad estimator. Also because we are searching for speed in this problem and Naive Bayes is relatively easy to compute. You just need to count to get the probabilities, and since we don't have a lot of data points, and there are only 2 classes (pass or fail), it will compute really fast.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Easy to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Doesn't work if you have missing features in an example and the tree has a node where it examines that feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Fast once is trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Can represent complicated boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Doesn't require much data preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) People that are not related to Machine Learning can understand easily if you provide a visual represntation of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Aplications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decisions tree are used in multiple classification problems like: Finding students with learning dissabilities, tumor classification, stars classification from images from the hubble telescope, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do I chose it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the amount of data is small enough to don't get a complex tree. Therefore training and prediction will be pretty fast."

Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

Although Naive Bayes and Decision Tree performed a little faster (0.0010 seconds per prediction), it has a lower F1 score (0.75 for NB and 0.7377 for DecisionTree).

The way it works is by finding an equation that take as input the information of the student and gives as an output a -1 when the student won't fail the final exam, and 1 when he/she is going to fail it. The way we do this is by finding an equation that, when you enter stundents' information as parameters gets the most predictions correctly. But there is another thing that makes this algorithm great. Imagine you draw the failing and not failing students in a board (see picture bellow and imagine that the x's are the failing students and the ceros are the students that passed). In this case, a simple line can divide the 2 groups prefectly. This line is the equation we want to find, but if we maximize the distance between the closest example from each class, it will be a better \"separator\". This distance is called margin. This algorithm (SVM) also maximes the margin to get even better classifications. As you can see in the attached image bellow, the line that seperates the data more accurately is the line 1, which is the line with more margin.\n",
